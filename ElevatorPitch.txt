My project will be a movie project using the Open Movie Poster API (OMDB). This is a cool cheap API
that returns beautiful classic movie posters. 

My project will have a search bar that allows a user to input search terms for movies. The output
will be a container that contains movie posters from the database. The user will be able to login and 
save favorite movie posters to their account. By clicking their avatar once they log in, the userw
will open an overlay in which they can see their highlighted movies. 

I plan to use React Routing to create the login and default home page. I will implement a login.
I haven't thought too much about how to implement the login yet but can use Firebase as a database
if that proves to be the easiest way. 

Over the next week, I will begin creating the components for my project and developing the 
search algorithm/fetch. I will implement routing and state. I will use Material UI for the overlay and for the 
styling.

Over the following week, I will figure out how to do the login and how to have unique logins for the user. 
I anticipate this to be the trickiest part. 

I plan on working this solo, as my work schedule has been a bit crazy and I plan on working weird hours.
